# The-Bean-Coffee-Shop-Chain
This project is in the making. 
When completed, it will consist of a website through which:
- a customer can see the data and products of all the cafes within a chain of cafes;
- a customer can place an order at any of the cafes;
- a worker can receive the order and confirm it;
- an admin can delete client accounts.
These features may change over time.

# For this project I used:
- Java Spring;
- Neo4j - graph database;
- Vue.js (Vuetify) - framework.

Run npm run serve. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/login, from there you can see the first part of the project which contains: login (POST), register (POST). After you click login, there are a list of users displayed (GET) and the posibility to edit or delete data (PUT, DELETE).
